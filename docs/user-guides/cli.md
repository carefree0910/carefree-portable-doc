`carefree-portable` üì¶Ô∏è is installed with a **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (CLI) tool called `cfport`, which can help you generating a starter configuration and package your project.

Since we utilized the great [`click`](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) library, you can use `cfport --help` to get more information about the CLI tool.
