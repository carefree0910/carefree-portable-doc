:::note
Priorities are from top to bottom, but subject to change (based on your needs!), and suggestions/contributions are truly welcomed!!

## Features

- [x] Use `venv` to create portable packages for linux / macos.

> This is not completly ideal - because it requires users to have Python environment, which means it is not completely portable - but may serve as a good start. 

- [ ] Try to support packaging `nodejs` environment.

> So we can create portable web projects!
