- [mixtral](https://github.com/carefree0910/carefree-portable/blob/main/examples/mixtral), which can generate a portable gradio demo for the famous [`Mixtral-8x7B` LLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/mixtral).
- [Stable Diffusion Web UI](https://github.com/carefree0910/carefree-portable/blob/main/examples/sd_webui), which can generate a portable version of the famous [A1111 webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).
- [Stable Diffusion - Playground v2](https://github.com/carefree0910/carefree-portable/blob/main/examples/sd_playground_v2), which can generate a portable version of the brilliant [Playground v2 HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/playgroundai/playground-v2).
  - `Playground v2` itself is a fantastic SD model. It is said that images generated by `Playground v2` are favored **2.5** times more than those produced by SDXL. See their [user study](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic#user-study) for more details.
